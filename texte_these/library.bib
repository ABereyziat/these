abstract = {This paper discusses a series of four-point bending tests that were conducted to failure on unreinforced, reinforced and reinforced-prestressed glue laminated (glulam) timber beams with steel-bars in a simply-supported scheme to determine their flexural behavior. The cross sectional ratio between the steel and the wood was 0.82%. To increase the level of reinforcement, some reinforced beams were prestressed by applying a moderate force to the lower bar. The experimental and numerical data provided the load-deflection, load-strain relationships and strain profiles of the tested beams. The results of the reinforced beams showed that the mechanical strength, the load-carrying capacity and the stiffness for both the simple and prestressed beams were enhanced compared to the unreinforced beams. For the simply reinforced beams, the stiffness increased by 25.9%, the ultimate load increased by 48.1% and the ductility increased by 43.8%. For the reinforced and prestressed beams, the stiffness increased by 37.9%, the ultimate load increased by 40.2%, and the ductility increased by 79.1%. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) is an electrometallurgical technique that enables the direct production of metal in the liquid state from oxide feedstock, and compared with traditional methods of extractive metallurgy offers both a substantial simplification of the process and a significant reduction in energy consumption. MOE is also considered a promising route for mitigation of CO 2 emissions in steelmaking, production of metals free of carbon, and generation of oxygen for extra-terrestrial exploration. Until now, MOE has been demonstrated using anode materials that are consumable (graphite for use with ferro-alloys and titanium) or unaffordable for terrestrial applications (iridium for use with iron). To enable metal production without process carbon, MOE requires an anode material that resists depletion while sustaining oxygen evolution. The challenges for iron production are threefold. First, the process temperature is in excess of 1, 538 degrees Celsius (ref. 10). Second, under anodic polarization most metals inevitably corrode in such conditions. Third, iron oxide undergoes spontaneous reduction on contact with most refractory metals and even carbon. Here we show that anodes comprising chromium-based alloys exhibit limited consumption during iron extraction and oxygen evolution by MOE. The anode stability is due to the formation of an electronically conductive solid solution of chromium(iii) and aluminium oxides in the corundum structure. These findings make practicable larger-scale evaluation of MOE for the production of steel, and potentially provide a key material component enabling mitigation of greenhouse-gas emissions while producing metal of superior metallurgical quality. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Fire behavior of cross-laminated timber (CLT) has been well documented in the past decade by several research organizations and universities across North America, Europe and Japan. The recent revision of ANSI/APA PRG 320 introduced two mandatory adhesive test methods to greatly reduce the potential for heat delamination. This research evaluated CLT face-bonded with adhesives that meet these new requirements, namely with respect to the resulting charring rate and potential contribution to fire growth and intensity in a compartment fire. The results suggest that CLT manufactured with an adhesive that meets the 2018 ANSI/APA PRG 320 requirements could be designed using a constant one-dimensional charring rate during a standard fire exposure. Results of room fire tests also showed that compartments made of CLT elements manufactured with non-delaminating adhesives eventually reached burn-out of the fuel content in several tests, leading to self-extinguishment.},

@phdthesis{Khorasani2011,
abstract = {This thesis involves a detailed study of steel-wood hybrid structures and their applications in construction industry. Hybrid structures combine benefits of dissimilar materials to overcome their individual limitations. Various advantages and challenges of steel-timber hybrid structures are presented. Benefits include increase in tensile capacity, seismic performance, fire resistance of the structure, and cost savings. Challenges with this type of hybrid structures originate from the differences in the properties of the materials used. Connection design may be more difficult as temperature and humidity variations have different effects on steel and timber. The hybrid materials can be integrated at component levels (hybrid slab/diaphragms, hybrid beams, hybrid columns, hybrid diagonals, hybrid post-tensioned joints) and/or at the building system levels (hybrid frames, hybrid system of steel frames and wood diaphragms, vertical mixed system and hybrid trusses). To elaborate on these types of hybridization and their advantages and challenges, case studies of steel-timber, concrete-timber and steel-concrete structures are provided. Despite the obvious advantages, today's applications of wood-steel hybrid structures have been limited. Currently there are no material and design standards for hybrid wood-steel structures. For light structures, NAHB Research Center has developed a builder's guide to hybrid wood and steel connection details. When combining steel and wood, designers should consider the advantages and limitation of each material and optimally utilize them. The literature review has highlighted the opportunity for wood-steel hybrid buildings and existing knowledge gaps. Another aim of this thesis is to investigate technical software packages and identify the pros and cons of each software pachage for modeling hybrid structures. The considered software packages are ANSYS, SAPWood, SeismoStruct and OpenSees Navigator. Software packages are evaluated interms of their ability to model linear and non linear materials; orthotropic and isotropic materials and composite materials. Among the softwares ANSYS is found to be the most suitable for modelling hybrid wood and steel structures. A case study of a hybrid structure consisting of steel momet frame and wood shear wall is modeled with ANSYS. Static analysis is performed on the structure and it is observed that wood shear wall significantly reduce the lateral deflection of the system.},

The 50mm thick planks of sugi around the steel were fixed with spirally threaded nails (screws), and 25mm long wood plugs were used to cover the tops of the nails. The 50mm thick glulam showed 1h of fire resistance. The temperatures of the flanges and webs of steel were 100°C at 1h and 200°C after 4h. The epoxy resin used to bond the wood and steel was an appropriate adhesive from a recycling perspective because it is easy to separate or peel from the steel.},

abstract = {This paper describes a series of three full-scale furnace tests on post-tensioned LVL box beams loaded with vertical loads, and presents a proposed fire design method for post-tensioned timber members. The design method is adapted from the calculation methods given in Eurocode 5 and NZS:3603 which includes the effects of changing geometry and several failure mechanisms specific to post-tensioned timber. The design procedures include an estimation of the heating of the tendons within the timber cavities, and relaxation of post-tensioning forces. Additionally, comparisons of the designs and assumptions used in the proposed fire design method and the results of the full-scale furnace tests are made. The experimental investigation and development of a design method have shown several areas which need to be addressed. It is important to calculate shear stresses in the timber section, as shear is much more likely to govern compared to solid timber. The investigation has shown that whilst tensile failures are less likely to govern the fire design of post-tensioned timber members, due to the axial compression of the post-tensioning, tensile stresses must still be calculated due to the changing centroid of the members as the fire progresses. Research has also highlighted the importance of monitoring additional deflections and moments caused by the high level of axial loads.},

abstract = {Cold-formed steel (CFS) and cross-laminated timber (CLT) structural components are widely employed in low- to mid-rise and modular building constructions. These two materials have individually shown to be lightweight, and possess relatively higher strength characteristics. Owing to these benefits, composite CLT-CFS sections can be used as structural elements and possibly be employed in modular buildings with enhanced structural performances. This paper presents the development of CLT-CFS composite beam for the floor system in modular buildings and investigates the structural performances through finite element (FE) analyses. Initially, the FE models of CFS beam and CLT panel were developed and validated with experimental results. Validated models were used to develop the FE model of CLT-CFS composite beam for the floor system. Results of FE analyses of the CLT-CFS composite floor systems showed that considerable benefits in terms of structural response can be achieved due to the mobilisation of composite action. For the CLT-CFS system investigated in this research, about 20% of enhancement in moment capacity was found. The presented study leads a path to highlight the gains in the structural performance of CLT-CFS composite beams floor system and it is a prospective option to be employed in sustainable modular building construction.},

@article{Ehrhart2018,
abstract = {Shear stresses in planes perpendicular to the grain, so-called rolling shear stresses, need to be considered in the ultimate and serviceability limit state design of many timber structural elements. Knowledge about the rolling shear modulus and strength has further gained in importance since the invention and increased use of cross laminated timber (CLT). As a result of the orthogonal orientation of adjacent layers within CLT, rolling shear stresses develop when CLT is subjected to out-of-plane bending. Previous numerical and experimental studies on rolling shear are largely restricted to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). In the present study, experimental investigations on the rolling shear properties were carried out on six timber species. The two investigated coniferous species were Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Four deciduous species, namely European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), poplar (Populus tremula L.), and European birch (Betula pendula R.) were investigated. Furthermore, different board geometries and sawing patterns were investigated. In comparison to Norway spruce, all other investigated species featured higher rolling shear properties. In particular, these of European beech and European ash were roughly three-times higher. In agreement with previous findings, the aspect ratio (board width vs. board thickness) as well as sawing pattern were identified as main influencing parameters on the rolling shear properties. In addition to single board segments, multi-segment systems were experimentally tested and numerically investigated. Parallel systems consisting of either two or four board segments were tested to obtain information on potential system effects of laminations within single CLT cross layers regarding rolling shear strength and rolling shear modulus, i.e. stresses may be distributed depending on the local stiffness. This system effect may influence the shear strength, the shear modulus, and the failure behaviour compared to the results of single segment testing. Often, CLT elements consist of more than one cross layer. Layups can also feature parallel layers, however, usually with grain in direction of the main span direction. Some of these layups have a remarkable potential for two-dimensional load transfer. Thus, these commonly double or triple layers are exposed to rolling shear by stresses in the weak load transfer direction. As rolling shear failure of one of the cross layers in layups featuring alternating orthogonal layers as well as layups featuring some parallel layers leads to the ultimate failure of the entire element, such elements can be considered as serial systems with regard to the rolling shear strength and rolling shear modulus. In order to investigate the serial-parallel system behaviour, multi-segment systems consisting of 4 × 3 board segments were tested. The investigated systems should allow linking the results obtained from single element testing to the actual behaviour of CLT laminations and, subsequently, to give recommendations for rolling shear test configurations as well as related rolling shear properties. The outcomes show a good comparability between the results from out-of-plane bending tests on CLT elements featuring rolling shear failures and EN 408-alike shear tests conducted on board segments. The analysis of the within- and between-boards variation of rolling shear properties and density is also a part of this paper. The results of this study provide an overview of the rolling shear properties of tested European softwood and hardwood species. The investigated species are already in use, or have a significant potential to be used for construction purposes in the near future. The findings regarding the influential material- and product-related parameters contribute to a better understanding of the mechanical behaviour of timber subjected to rolling shear.},

abstract = {In steel composite constructions, replacing the concrete slabs with prefabricated timber slabs significantly reduces the embodied energy and carbon footprint and lowers the self-weight of the structure and the size of the columns and footings. Considering the advantages of the light-weight steel-timber composite (STC) floors, this paper presents the results of laboratory experiments conducted on six (STC) beam-to-column subassemblies with double angle web cleats and fin plate (nominally-pinned) connections. Preserving continuity of the slabs across the column increases hogging bending moment resistance and stiffness of the composite beam to column connections. Here, the connection between the timber slabs across the column was provided by threaded rods placed inside the timber slabs and mechanically anchored in the pockets of cementitious grout. The STC subassemblies were subjected to a monotonically increasing push-down load to simulate behaviour of the nominally-pinned beam-to-column connections. The results of laboratory tests revealed that mechanically anchored rods can be used to effectively transfer the tensile force developed in the timber slabs of the STC floors and accordingly enhance the stiffness and hogging bending moment capacity of the simple STC beam-to-column connections. The effect of the number, size, and strength grade of the steel rods on stiffness, strength and ductility of the STC connections were evaluated experimentally and component-based method was employed to develop a simple mechanical model for predicting the bending moment capacity of the STC connections with mechanically anchored rods.},

abstract = {In fire design of timber structures the charring rate of the material is a very important property, but the charring rate varies with the conditions in the fire compartment and the characteristics of the wood. Many experiments have been carried out through the years, trying to determine the effect of various properties on the charring rate of wood. This paper gives a summary of the material properties and external factors found in the literature to have the largest influence on the charring rate of exposed wood, i.e. the density, moisture content, chemical composition, grain orientation, permeability, scale effect, thermal exposure, char contraction, char oxidation, oxygen concentration and opening factor, resulting from experiments found in the literature. It has not been possible to determine which properties or factors have the most significant influence on the charring rate of wood, due to large differences between the test conditions and methods, wood species and measurement methods. There is a great need for further testing to determine the relative effect of these properties and factors, and international test methods need to be developed to enable comparison of results from research all over the world. More information about the most important properties and factors can help standardise the calculation of charring of wood, and improve the input to computer models for fire safety design. This will result in more economic fire design of wooden structures, as the calculated residual cross sections will be closer to reality. Copyright},

abstract = {This paper investigates the mechanical behaviour of lap steel-timber composite connections using a 3-D continuum-based finite element (FE) model. In the FE models developed, the non-linear behaviour and failure of the timber is captured by a stress-based failure criterion formulated in the framework of continuum-damage mechanics. Yielding of the steel plates and fasteners (i.e. coach screws and bolts) is captured by an elastic-hardening plastic constitutive law. These FE models are validated by experimental (push-out) tests conducted on laminated veneer lumber (LVL)-steel and cross-laminated timber (CLT)-steel composite lap connections. It is shown that the FE models developed in the paper can replicate adequately the load-slip response and failure mode of the hybrid steel-timber composite connections tested. The validated FE model is used to undertake a parametric study that elucidates the influence of the yield strength and the length of the fasteners and the post-tensioning force in the bolts on the stiffness, load carrying capacity and load-slip behaviour of hybrid steel-timber composite connections.},

abstract = {This thesis encompasses the investigation of a novel proposed construction system that pairs Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) floor panels with steel-frame multi-storey construction. As a substitute for concrete floors, the promise of CLT lies in its reduced embodied carbon, and its lightness, which gives the promise of reduced material usage and a reduction in the environmental impact of a multi-storey building overall. In addition to clarifying the environmental benefit such a system provides, this thesis seeks to determine whether forming composite sections from the CLT panels and the steel beam, can lead to meaningful enhancements to the section stiffness in bending. Finite element analysis is applied for this task, necessitating first a methodology for modelling CLT to capture its relevant complexities as a material, and subsequently incorporation of the behaviour of the joints between structural elements in the proposed system, with the key characteristics of the materials and joint models validated against physical test data. Focusing predominantly on a slimfloor arrangement of panels and beams, the study provides the first evaluation of the effective width of CLT floor panels when acting compositely with steel beams, provides a prediction for composite action CLT panels and Asymmetric Steel Beams (ASBs) with a series of connectors, and identifies areas of development within the system that could bring about increased composite benefits. The outcomes of the study are that in a slimfloor arrangement with contemporary panels, beams and connectors, the composite enhancement is small but measurable, and that with changes and development to the system components, much larger composite enhancement effects could be generated.},

abstract = {This study describes an approach to determine the thermal conductivity of wood at elevated temperatures. The aim is to be able to use the developed conductivity as input in structural elements in finite element calculations. The conductivity of pine wood and glue laminated timber with different densities and moisture contents have been evaluated where small scale one-dimensional laboratory trials have been carried out in a cone calorimeter. Steel temperatures were measured behind the exposed wood samples. Obtained temperatures from the experimental trials have been compared with back calculated steel temperatures in the finite element program TASEF (Temperature Analysis in Structures Exposed to Fire). In the back calculations the conductivity at 100 °C, 300 °C and 500 °C was altered in order to achieve a best fit steel temperature curve as the measured ones during the experimental trials. At 20 °C the conductivity was taken from the literature. Between these temperature levels the conductivity was assumed to vary linearly. The dehydration of the moisture content in the wood samples have been considered by including it in the specific volumetric enthalpy, i.e. the integral over temperature of the density and specific heat as input in the temperature calculation program TASEF. Regarding the thermal degradation, recommended formulas in Eurocode 5: Design of timber structures – Part 1-2: General – Structural fire design, have been applied. The final back calculated conductivity values of the studied pine wood at specific temperatures (20 °C, 100 °C, 300 °C och 500 °C) were determined by the cone calorimeter test to be as follows; 0.09 W/mK, 0.07 W/mK, 0.05 W/mK and 0.35 W/mK. Comparing with presented conductivity of wood in Eurocode 5 the developed conductivity in this study are generally lower. Derived conductivity values from the back calculations in TASEF have been reconsidered for the glue laminated timber by taken account of differences in density and moisture content. By using a developed conversion factor, so called “conductivity ratio”, new conductivity values could be obtained which then has been used as an input in TASEF. As a result, good similarities between calculated steel temperatures and measured steel temperatures could be seen. The implemented method, consisting of simple one-dimensional laboratory trials for determining the thermal conductivity is deemed to be promising. However, further studies are needed to be done in order to increase the accuracy of the method.},

The manual consists of two parts. The material in Part 1, which consists of three chapters, is mainly descriptive. Chapter 1 deals with various aspects related to structural fire protection, including building codes and the role of structural fire protection. Chapter 2 discusses the development of fire in enclosures and the effect of fire on the behavior of concrete, steel, and wood, including the properties of these materials at elevated temperatures. Chapter 3 describes methods for the calculation of the fire resistance of various structural members. Part 2, which consists of Chapters 4 and 5, deals with the development of fire and the calculation of fire resistance using mathematical models, respectively. It is hoped that, in addition to providing a basis for new standards, this manual will also be useful to architects, engineers, building officials and students in any branch concerned with structural fire safety.},

abstract = {Cellulosic materials decompose on heating or exposure to an ignition source by two alternative pathways. The first pathway, which dominates at temperatures below 300 °C, involves reduction in the degree of polymerization by bond scission; elimination of water; formation of free radicals, carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroperoxide groups; evolution of CO and CO2; and, finally, production of a highly reactive carbonaceous char. The second pathway, which takes over at temperatures above 300 °C, involves cleavage of molecules by transglycosylation, fission, and disproportionation reactions to provide a mixture of tarry anhydro sugars and lower molecular weight volatile products. Oxidation of the reactive char gives smoldering or glowing combustion, and oxidation of the combustible volatiles gives flaming combustion. Flaming combustion could be retarded by inorganic materials that suppress the formation of the combustible volatiles through dehydration and charring of the substrate. The smoldering combustion could be suppressed or enhanced by catalysts that affect the rates of oxidation of the char to CO ($\Delta$H = 22.9 kcal/mol) and CO2 ($\Delta$H = -88.5 kcal/mol). The kinetics and mechanisms of the thermal decomposition, the rates of combustion and heat release, the composition of the pyrolysis products, and the formation and reactivity of char have been investigated extensively to provide a chemical description for combustion and fire prevention.},

abstract = {This review encompasses the available practical and experimental data on the ignition of solid wood. Only solid, natural wood is considered, not sawdust, chips, or products that have been treated with fire retardants or other substances, nor the ignition of living trees. Panel products such as plywood or particleboard have ignition properties very similar to solid wood, so the solid-wood results will generally be applicable to them. Wood may ignite by flaming directly, or it may ignite in a glowing mode, which may or may not be followed by flaming. It is shown that the ignition temperature is around 250 C for wood exposed to the minimum heat flux possible for ignition, and that it invariably ignites, at least initially, in a glowing mode under these conditions. The ignition temperature rises rapidly as the heat flux is increased. Piloted ignition at heat fluxes sufficient to cause a direct-flaming ignition normally occurs at surface temperatures of 300?365 C. Autoignition temperatures at fluxes higher than minimum are essentially unknown. No theory is available that encompasses the possibility of glowing, glowing followed by flaming, or direct-flamingig nition modes. Most published studies have dealt with radiant or radiant+convective heating, and knowledge is extremely poor for ignition from direct contact by hot bodies or by flames. A species-independent correlation is derived for the radiant, piloted ignition of thermally-thick wood, but the fit is only fair. The minimum flux for ignition is 4.3kWm - 2, based on a single study; most reported tests have been much too brief to produce useful data on this point.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Buildings in Japan have been constructed using timber since olden times. At the same time, Japan is a country beset by earthquake and timber buildings were weak against fire. So, from 1950 to 1987 wooden buildings over 13m height were prohibited by law. Revision of the Building Standards Law 2000 allowed the construction of buildings four-story or taller with fire-resistance performance. M-Bldg. built in 2005 is the first five-storied timber building after established Building Standard Law in Japan. This paper describes the structural framing and fire resistance system for this building and details. M-Bldg. was built in Kanazawa city, Ishikawa prefecture. In this building, first-story was built in reinforced concrete construction and from 2-5 stories was built in timber-based hybrid construction. In structural framing, the performance-based design method (" Calculation of Response and Limit Strength ") was applied and some static structural experiments were conducted about the seismic performance of shearing wall and the buckling stress of timber-based hybrid column. In fire resistance system, fireproof construction was needed for this building. Three fireproof elements, column, girder and bracing, were tested for 1 hour fire resistive period. All elements could have enough properties for 1 hour fire resistance. The possibilities of middle-rise and high-rise timber buildings are extended by completion of this building.},

abstract = {In this paper, non-linear finite elements models (FEM) of steel-timber composite (STC) beams have been developed and analyzed using ABAQUS software. In the FEM, the loading conditions of STC beams were simulated, and the nonlinear behaviour of the contact interface between the steel and timber components were incorporated adequately into the FEM. For the yield load, the maximum error between the FE results and the experimental results is 14.85%. The maximum average error of the yield deflection is 12.94%. and of the ultimate load is 16.79%. However, the error of key points was less than 17% (within a reasonable range), which proves that the established finite element model, selected material parameters and contact element model can better simulate the bending performance of STC beams. Finally, a parametric study was carried out by using the verified FEM. It is shown that the FEM developed in this study can replicate adequately the load-deflection response, and the development of stress and plasticity of the bending experiment. Through the parameter study, it can be seen that the distribution density and mechanical properties of the connection between the glulam and H-section steel can affect the mechanical behavior of the whole STC beams.},

The use of lightweight concrete in such innovative construction methods offers lightweight structures with better heat and sound insulation compared to normal weight concrete. It is worth noting that fire and energy performance has become central to building design. However, there are limited research studies on the combined thermal energy and fire performance of 3DPC walls. Therefore, this study investigates fire performance of 20 numbers of varying 3DPC wall configurations using validated finite element models under standard fire conditions. The fire performance analysis demonstrated that 3DPC non-load bearing cavity walls have substantial resistance under standard fire load and its performance can be further improved with Rockwool insulation. There is significant improvement in terms of fire performance when the thickness of the walls increases in a parallel row manner. Previous thermal energy investigation also showed a lower U-value for increased thickness of similar 3DPC walls. This research concludes with a proposal of using 3DPC wall with Rockwool insulation for amplified combined thermal energy and fire performance to be used in MBS.},

abstract = {Experiments were conducted to quantify the magnitude and contribution of flame heat feedback and char oxidation on the burning of timber. Using both oxidative and inert environments (air and nitrogen) a methodology was developed to determine the individual contribution of flame and char oxidation. The rate of pyrolysis, expressed through the mass loss rate, was used to calculate the individual contributions of flame heat flux and char oxidation. The process of timber combustion was divided into an initial transient regime and quasi-steady regime. Equivalent heat flux contributions were calculated using the mass loss rate and the heat of pyrolysis. At the peak mass loss rate, the flame heat feedback contributed up to 60% of the total mass loss rate. The total contribution of flame radiation and char oxidation was determined to be constant with incident applied heat flux at quasi-steady state (2.5–2.9 kW/m2). However, the contribution towards peak mass loss rate decreases at higher incident heat fluxes. Flame heat fluxes were calculated between 19.9 and 20.6 kW/m2 at low external heat fluxes (20 and 25 kW/m2). The resulting heat flux contributions agree with previous studies, with particularly good agreement at lower heat fluxes.},

Eighteen beams were made in different compositions and tested to ultimate capacity. Some specimens were designed as I-shaped steel sections (core elements) encased in timber sections, whilst some sections included top and/or bottom reinforcement only. In addition to the composite functionality expected from the designed beams, this research aimed to restrict the buckling of steel beams once the timber is attached to their body acting as a sandwich composite. The beams were designed considering the feasibility of the production of these elements in the real world. Significant capacity improvement and ductility boost were achieved for composite sections compared to the plain timber elements, which makes the proposed designs promising for further investigation.},

abstract = {One fundamental prerequisite for analytical treatment of the design process for wood structures exposed to fire is the development of an analytical model for the essential physical process in heated wood material. The model must be capable of treating transient temperature and moisture states in both uncharred and charred portions of the cross-section, as well as the growth of the charred layer in combination with its oxidation at the surface due to variable thermal action. Material data for such a model must also be produced. The calculations in this work are based on the model developed by the author. Simulations have been made with the one-dimensional computer program WOOD1. The input data which have been varied in the calculations are the thickness, density, moisture content and thermal exposure of the material. These few and simple input data are of a type that are known in conjunction with a fire engineering design. The results of all calculations are presented in diagrams in which the three different calculated quantities have been set out as a function of the distance from the surface exposed to fire at different times. The presentation comprises temperature profile, density distribution and moisture profile. Assessment of the fire resistance of the board material is based on the same performance requirements as those set out in the internationally accepted test method, ISO 834, or its Swedish counterpart SIS 02 48 20. This implies for the calculations that the fire resistance is taken to be the time when the insulation requirement is no longer complied with, i.e. when the rise in temperature on the unexposed face exceeds 140°C. A comparison of the calculated fire resistances and those measured in the tests shows very good agreement. The maximum difference between the tests and the calculations is only about 1 min for boards. For the wall constructions the maximum difference is larger, but normally not more than 10 min. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

A total number of 85 specimens were tested in 6 different configurations. A varying degree of nonlinearity was observed between the different configurations and material planes, especially for rolling shear. The stress–strain curves were adapted with linear, bilinear and Voce models. Compared to the linearized variant, it was found that the bilinear model generally increases the model accuracy by a factor of approximately two, whereas the Voce model showed even higher accuracy, although its adaptive robustness was somewhat lower. The parameters demonstrated low correlations to density, whereas the correlations with the initial shear moduli in many cases were considerably higher and significant.

abstract = {The present study investigated the structural behaviour of aluminium-timber composite (ATC) beams. In the proposed ATC system, a timber slab was connected to aluminium girders by hexagon head wood screws. ATC beams are a relatively new civil engineering solution and their behaviour should be investigated to develop relevant methods for calculating their resistance. The authors examined the stiffness and the strength of the screwed connection used to join an aluminium girder with a timber slab. The slip moduli k0.4 and k0.6, and the peak load capacity per one connector were determined experimentally in two push-out tests. These parameters are necessary for designing ATC beams, because the behaviour of an ATC system is depended on the stiffness and the strength of its connections. Moreover, two bending tests were conducted on ATC beams to investigate their short-term behaviour, determine their bending resistance and capture the mode of failure, load-deflection and load-slip response. Based on the guidelines for timber and composite (steel-timber and steel-concrete) elements, the authors of this paper proposed the methods for calculating the bending resistance of the ATC beams, and the stiffness and strength of their screwed connections. The results obtained in the experimental tests were compared with the results from the analytical estimations. In addition, non-linear 3D finite element (FE) models of the tested composite beams and connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. The comparison between the experimental and numerical results demonstrated that the adopted 3D models were able to adequately capture the response of the ATC composite beams and their connections. These models may be used in further numerical analysis of ATC structures, e.g., to evaluate the impact of the number of the shear connectors on the load-bearing capacity of an ATC beam.},

abstract = {The quantification of moisture transport in heated wood is relevant to several fields, e.g. for lumber drying and processing and for fire safety risk assessment. We present non-destructive and simultaneous measurements of the moisture content and temperature distributions in pine wood during unilateral exposure to a heat source. The moisture content is measured by a nuclear magnetic resonance setup specifically built for the evaluation of moisture transport in porous materials at elevated temperatures. Temperature profiles are obtained by thermocouples placed at different distances from the exposed surface. While the temperature rises, a peak in the moisture content is formed, which travels towards the unexposed surface. The velocity of the moisture content peak depends on the principal direction in which transport occurs, as confirmed by experiments. Numerical simulations of moisture transport are performed which can qualitatively reproduce the behavior observed in experiments. Moreover, several characteristics, such as the timescale and non-linearity of the moisture peak position, are well captured. The influence of several input parameters, such as the permeability and diffusion coefficient, on the moisture peak dynamics is elaborately explored.},

abstract = {Connections within timber structures are highly vulnerable areas when exposed to fire, especially when made of fasteners with different thermal and mechanical properties. This mechanical cohabitation can generate, because of material permeability differences, additional physico-chemical phenomena. These phenomena are affected by the coupling of heat and moisture transfers, which can alter the mechanical behaviour of timber structures. In order to improve our knowledge of the thermo-hydric timber connection, a series of experimental tests has been carried out and numerical models have been developed by taking the experimental observations into account. The experimental campaign concerns timber-to-timber and timber-steel-timber connections exposed to an "ISO 834" fire. The connections studied are real joints made of timber members, with and without a median metal plate, and maintained using bolts or dowels. The present study was conducted to examine heat transfer while taking the hydric effects at the interface between timber and steel fasteners into account. To analyse the experimental results and adjust the thermo-physical parameters for numerical modelling, numerical thermal fields, finite differences "FDM" and finite elements "FEM", models are developed. Numerical and experimental results are in good agreement. Nevertheless, some observations are made and discussed by comparing numerical results with experimental ones. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is proposed in this work to study experimentally different possibilities of steel-timber beams in bending. The aim of those tests is to identify some key points such as the shear connection necessary to allow a total composite action and the ratio of the reinforcement provided by the timber elements to the steel beams. Each steel beam is connected to two timber beams at the web and the flanges. In order to define the material properties of the tested elements, each component (wood and steel) has been tested independently in the elastic field. Then, the timber and steel beams have been connected and tested until the failure. The observed behaviour show a significant effect of the reinforcement provided by the timber beams. In fact, the combination of timber-steel elements delays the lateral buckling and the local buckling of the steel profile. Those preliminary experimental studies are used to evaluate the performances of different means of connection and the possibilities of the combination of timber and steel elements for further developments.},

Axial capacity and failure were focused on as well as the strength-to-mass ratio for each specimen. There was a noticeable capacity difference between the side-loaded and mid-loaded specimens of each group indicating the effect of material under loading on the capacity. The side-loaded specimens had a higher interface between the loading element and steel, compared to the mid-loaded specimens.

However, only limited research has been undertaken in the past on the structural properties of cold-formed FRS, especially at elevated temperatures. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on key mechanical properties of FRS after subjecting to elevated temperatures. The steady-state tensile tests were performed on two different types of FRS and a CSS at different elevated temperatures ranging from 100° to 800 °C with a holding time of 60 min. A total number of 99 tensile coupon test specimens were tested in this study, both at room and elevated temperatures. Important observations have been made in the paper about the performance of FRS at elevated temperatures in terms of stress-strain relationships, mechanical properties, and deformability parameters. The test results indicate the better performance of FRS compared to CSS at elevated temperature greater than 400 °C suggesting a possible application of FRS in steel structures liable to be exposed to fire conditions. Constitutive modeling for steels is also proposed for strength and stiffness properties.},

abstract = {Various solutions are used for steel-timber hybrid elements that associate two timber beams on both sides of a steel plate or a steel profile. Steel is used as mechanical reinforcement to obtain hybrid elements with high performance regarding the strength and the stiffness. Wood is a combustible material but it burns in a controlled way with low thermal conductivity. Steel is non-combustible and shows high performances in normal conditions. However, its mechanical properties decrease dramatically at elevated temperatures. Previous work on wood-steel connections highlighted the wood protection effect enhanced by the migration of water in the wood element and the absorption of some of the fire energy by vaporization of the water contained in wood. The present study focuses on the thermal performances of steel-timber cross-sections to obtain the evolution of temperature on steel element during fire exposure. The aim is to evaluate the wood material as passive fire protection for steel elements in comparison with other common solutions. Experimental program is performed using different types of wood as insulation to protect steel profiles. The thermal gradient is measured in the protected steel section using different pieces of wood in different configurations: partial or full protection with three or four exposure sides of the hybrid cross section. The tests were performed on a furnace prototype developed in the laboratory. The temperatures are measured using type K thermocouples. Results are compared with those given by a finite element model and the analytical expressions of EN1993-1-2.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional finite element model is developed to predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of steel-to-timber doweled joints in tension parallel to grain exposed to fire. To manage the plastic yielding of the materials, the mechanical model is based on the von Mises criterion for steel and the Hill criterion for timber. In fire, the material characteristics depend on the temperature. Two different meshes are used for the thermal and the thermo-mechanical models. The thermal model is continuous, to take account of the thermal continuity between the joint components. The thermo-mechanical model is discontinuous, to consider the contact evolution between the joint components. The thermal model is used to predict the evolution of the temperature field inside the joint which depend on the gas temperature. It is validated on the basis of measured temperatures during fire tests. The complex transformations in wood during fire are represented by apparent values of thermo-physical characteristics proposed in the bibliography and calibrated on the basis of the experimental measurements. The mechanical model is validated by comparison with the experimental results of joints in normal conditions. The thermo-mechanical model is validated by considering the experimental failure times of some joints. The numerical models showed a good capacity to simulate the behavior of the timber joints in cold and in fire situations. These developed and tested models can be used as a general tool to analyze the behavior of a large variety of joint configurations to constitute a data base that can be used in safe and economic practice of fire engineering of wood joints.},

abstract = {This study examined the intrinsic differences in various wood properties between juvenile wood and mature wood in 10 major reforestation species in China. Comparisons between juvenile wood and mature wood were made in both plantation- and naturally-grown trees. Considerable differences in most wood properties were found both between plantation-grown juvenile wood and mature wood, and between naturally-grown juvenile wood and mature wood. This suggests that wood properties of plantation-grown trees, to a large extent, depends on their juvenile wood contents, and can thus be manipulated effectively through rotation age. In general, the longer the rotation age, the lower the juvenile wood content, and the stronger the mechanical properties of the plantation-grown woods. However, the differences between juvenile wood and mature wood vary with wood properties and species. In general, juvenile wood and mature wood have less difference in chemical composition than in anatomical and physico-mechanical properties. Compared to the softwoods studied, the hardwoods appear to have less difference between juvenile wood and mature wood.},

@article{SedighiGilani2015,
abstract = {Connections are often the weakest link in timber structures so that their failure during fire exposure may result in local or total collapse of a building. The failure modes are complex and poorly understood due to wood's orthotropicity, the temperature and moisture dependency of wood's properties, and the presence of metal fasteners that complicates the stress distribution and changes the process of heat transfer into the timber element. In this study, we investigated the coupled physics of heat and mass transfer in a test specimen made from spruce, with a steel fastener inserted in a pre-drilled hole. It imitates a central slice of a timber-to-timber connection exposed to the elevated temperature of 523 K from one side. The heat induced redistribution of the hygroscopic moisture in wood was quantified and visualized by means of neutron radiography. The temperature gradient was measured inside the specimen, at different distances from the heated surface. As the temperature increased in wood, moisture was displaced downstream of the heat source, resulting in a zone with increased moisture content ahead of the drying front and beneath the steel fastener. This wet front occurred where the temperature was below the water evaporation point. It was shown that the steel fastener affected the transport of heat and moisture within the test specimen. The occurring phenomena during the transient state may play a critical role in the embedment strength of wood and therefore influence the load-carrying capacity of timber connections in fire.},

abstract = {The application of reliability analysis to the fire performance of structural assemblies requires statistical data on both fire severity and fire resistance. Since the standard test for fire resistance of wood-frame wall assemblies is both time-consuming and costly, it would be desirable to have a numerical method that could be used in conjunction with fire tests to generate the data required for reliability analysis. A computer model, based on the finite element method, was developed to simulate the ASTM E-119 fire test of a wall assembly. This transient heat balance also models heat transfer across spaces within the wall assembly, such as a stud cavity. Spaces can exist at the start of the problem or be created and/or merged during program execution. Burnthrough of the wall facings is simulated by allowing elements to be removed from the problem when their temperatures exceed a critical value. The computer program allows basic material property data to be input either from a data file or interactively as the program is executed. The program was designed to generate data consistent with a reliability analysis and thus has the capability of sequentially solving problems for the same mesh, but with different material properties. Excellent agreement with published data was found in simulations of a wood slab exposed to fire. Simulations of uninsulated 2 x 4 wood stud walls, spaced 16" on center and with various wall facings, were in good agreement with the results of published ASTM E-119 wall tests. However, changes in the thickness of the wall facings did not always lead to changes in the fire endurance time that were of the same magnitude as that reported in the literature. This study demonstrated that computer simulations of wood-frame wall assemblies exposed to fire could be used to generate the fire resistance data necessary for reliability analysis. However, more research is needed on the thermal properties of wall materials.},

Thermal comfort requirements require careful envelope design coupled with the appropriate air-conditioning system operation strategies. One of the most prominent examples of such buildings is mosques. Mosques are usually occupied five intermittent times day and night all year round. Like any other building, they have to be mechanically air-conditioned to achieve the required thermal comfort for worshippers especially in harsh climatic regions. This paper describes the physical and operating characteristics typical for the intermittently occupied mosques as well as the results of the thermal optimization of a medium size mosque in the two hot-dry and hot-humid Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and Jeddah. The analysis utilizes a direct search optimization technique that is coupled to an hourly energy simulation program. Based on that, design guidelines are presented for the optimum thermal performance of mosques in these two cities in addition to other design and operating factors that need to be considered for mosques in general. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

This STC column is constructed by wrapping the H-shaped steel with the adhesive-applied glulam, which provides confinement to reduce the buckling behaviour of the inner steel. Six STC specimens with lengths of 1100 mm, 1700 mm and 2300 mm were studied using an axial compression test in comparison to three steel and three timber specimens. The distinctive behaviours of the specimens were identified, including the failure mode, load–axial displacement relationship, load–lateral deflection relationship and load–axial strain response. The results demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the STC column are significantly affected by column length. The interaction mechanism between the steel and timber materials was evaluated by analysing the yield strain and the ductility coefficient. The composite effect of the STC column was also discussed by comparing the average strengths. Furthermore, the load-carrying capacity calculation formula including parameter selection of the STC column when yielding was proposed.},

Although these beams can be combined with any type of structural floor, their use with concrete decks opens the door to new and promising structural strategies. Present-day timber-concrete floors are a good solution for contemporary multi-storey buildings. They provide in-plane stiffness, enough mass for sound isolation and can be optimized from a structural performance point of view. Meanwhile hybrid beams could provide lightness, reduced structural depth, reduce the creeping behaviour and make frame semi-rigid joints easy to build. The goal is therefore the development of a combined system of hybrid beams and concrete floors, proposing prefabricated or semi-prefabricated timber-steel-concrete ribbed elements that could make the most of all this potential.

The model was built in Ansys using the ansys parametric design language, such that the whole simulation process, including the creation of geometries, grain deviation, meshing and failure prediction, is automatically calculated by only introducing conventional measuring parameters of knots and locations of the pith. Knots are generated as elliptical, rotated and oblique cones. The local and global grain deviation is estimated by solving a multiphysics problem and equating the fibers of wood to the trajectory of laminar streamlines in 3-D. Wood is considered a transversely isotropic material with anisotropic plasticity in which the failure prediction is given by means of several phenomenological failure criteria. The model was validated with 4-point bending tests of Scots pine specimens showing errors in failure prediction of 5 %, errors in initial fracture location of less than 20 mm and errors of 9 % in photogrammetrically measured displacements of an average of 65 FE nodes, in which the heterogeneity of wood caused variations of up to 6 %.},

Due to the relative infancy of mass timber building techniques (particularly in the construction of tall buildings) the trajectory of this new and evolving architectural typology has not been widely studied. Recently, several market reviews have investigated the advantages, disadvantages and best practice for mass timber as a structural material and construction strategy. However, existing literature lacks an overview of the wider market context with particular emphasis on the architectural qualities and ramifications of the emerging tall wood building typology. This paper aims to provide a qualitative analysis of this market context to identify trends within mass timber construction. The study is particularly concerned with the potential for architectural variety (spatial and aesthetic) afforded by tall timber structural techniques, envelope systems, and fabrication methods. The research presented in this paper is the first step towards defining the prevailing architectural strategies within this mode of building that might help to understand how tall timber architecture is evolving.},

abstract = {Connecting timber panels to steel girders using mechanical fasteners (e.g. screws and bolts) is an attractive and novel method for developing a fully prefabricated and sustainable hybrid steel-timber composite (STC) floor that can also facilitate future dismantling and recycling of the structural components. This study concerns the short-term behaviour of innovative STC floors comprising of cross- laminated timber (CLT) and/or laminated veneer lumber (LVL) panels connected to steel girders by various mechanical fasteners and/or glue. The mechanical characteristics of STC connections play an essential role in the safe and economical design of hybrid STC structures and floor systems. Accordingly, at the first stage of this research project, short-term behaviour of STC connections has been investigated. Push-out tests on different types of STC lap joints are reported, and the load-slip behaviour, stiffness, strength and failure modes of the STC connections are characterised. At the second stage, short term behaviour of STC system was investigated through four-point bending tests. The results of four point bending tests performed on full-scale STC beams are reported and the structural behaviour of the proposed STC system are studied. At the last stage of the project, extensive non linear 1D and 2D finite element (FE) analyses of STC beams are carried out and the numerical results are verified against the test results. It is shown that 1D and 2D FE models can adequately capture the structural response of the STC beams. In addition, the mechanical behaviour of lap STC connections was investigated through using a nonlinear 3D continuum-based FE model. In the FE models developed, the non-linear behaviour and failure of the timber is captured by a stress- based failure criterion formulated in the framework of continuum damage mechanics. It is shown that the FE models developed can adequately predict the load-slip response and failure mode of the hybrid steel-timber composite connections tested. The validated FE model is used to undertake a parametric study that elucidates the influence of the yield strength and the length of the fasteners and the post-tensioning force in the bolts on the stiffness, load carrying capacity and load-slip behaviour of hybrid steel-timber composite connections.},

abstract = {This work focuses on the development of a three dimensional constitutive model for timber to simulate the flexural behaviour of hybrid timber-steel and timber-concrete beams. This is motivated by the lack of dedicated non linear material behaviour laws for timber in the commercial finite element software by compared to the conventional materials such as concrete and steel. The flexural behaviour of hybrid timber beams is very complex because of the combination of the two different material behaviours and their nonlinar and partial compostion action. Numerical simulation of such behaviour requires an accurate description of the nonlinear material behaviour, in particular that of timber because of its anisotropic nature. A realistic description of the material nonlinearities and of the composite action between the different materials could aid considerably in achieving acceptable predictions. An incremental approach based on the strong coupling between orthotropic elasticity, anisotropic plasticity with mixed nonlinear isotropic hardening and an isotropic damage is used. The developed constitutive model for timber is implemented in Abaqus code using an external subroutine. The 3D FE model is calibrated and validated through comparison with experimental data reported in literature. The model is able to predict the nonlinear structural response of hybrid beams in terms of load-midspan deflection, and provides an acceptable accuracy.},

Wood samples were thus equipped with both embedded thin wire thermocouples (0.1 mm diameter) and sheathed thermocouples (1 mm diameter) installed perpendicularly or in parallel to the conductive heat flux to compare the results between the two kinds of measurements. Afterwards, samples were exposed to the cone calorimeter at different heat fluxes (from 16.5 kW.m−2 to 93.5 kW.m−2) in order to measure both in-depth temperature and mass loss during the degradation. The smallness and high flexibility of thin embedded wire thermocouples enabled in-depth temperature measurement without affecting the mass loss measurement. This is usually not possible when using sheathed thermocouples, because of their high stiffness. Results showed that it is crucial to rigorously control the thermocouple implantation, as an underestimation up to was observed for thermocouples put near the surface exposed to the heat flux. There are several reasons for this difference: the heat sink due to conductive heat flux through the thermocouple body, a poor contact between the sensor and the sample and uncertainty about the actual position of the thermocouple. The char front evolution deduced from temperature measurement by wire thermocouples was found to comply with direct measurements of the char layer performed on samples. Finally, the charring rate obtained from in-depth temperature as a function of the heat flux was found to follow an affine law.},

abstract = {The combination of timber elements and steel beams can be of high interest for mechanical performances including instabilities and fire protection. In this paper, experiments and numerical modelling are performed to analyse the behavior of various configurations of steel-timber beams in bending. Two timber beams are connected to the web and the flanges of the steel beam. In order to define the material properties of the tested elements, each component (wood and steel) has been tested separately. Then, timber and steel beams have been connected and tested up to failure. The observed behavior shows a limited effect of hybridation in the elastic domain. However, the effect is significant at the ultimate stage. Actually, the combination of timber and steel elements improves the resistance to lateral torsional buckling and local buckling of the steel beam. The stiffness and the strength of these innovative hybrid structures are estimated at SLS and ULS respectively using approaches similar to those proposed in European design rules. The analytical values are close to those obtained from tests even with the failure reached by instability of steel element. However, it appears that for hybrid beams the calculated value of elastic critical bending moment for lateral-torsional buckling needs to be improved. These results highlight the potential of the steel-timber hybrid elements for further developments.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a steel-wood composite beam with H-shaped steel beam webs glued to the wood. As a new type of composite beam, it combines the advantages of low energy consumption of wood, high permeability, and less pollution and the advantages of light weight and high strength of steel, high degree of assembly, short construction period, and less construction waste generated. Carrying out research is of great significance to improve the mechanical properties of steel-wood composite beams and promote the development of steel-wood composite structures. In this paper, three hot-rolled H-beam-larch composite beams and one pure steel beam were tested for bending capacity. The composite beams are divided into two different combinations of A and B types. The two sides of the web are connected with larch wood by structural glue to form a composite beam. The type B composite beam is a larch wood glued on both sides of the H-shaped steel web and penetrates the bolts at the same time. Through the three-point monotonic static grading loading of the composite beam, the deflection change, failure phenomenon, and form of the specimen during the experiment were observed. Under the circumstances, the ultimate bearing capacity of the test piece was changed to study the combined effect of larch and hot-rolled H-shaped steel. The results show that the overall performance of the H-shaped steel-larch composite beam is good. Bonding wooden boards on both sides of the steel beam web can improve the bearing capacity, and the form of the member is more reasonable and effective; increasing the cross-sectional size of the H-beam in the steel-wood composite beam can further improve the bearing capacity of the composite beam; adding bolt anchorage on the basis of the structural glue used in the composite beam can further improve the bearing capacity of the composite beam. The superposition principle is used to simplify the calculation of the ultimate bearing capacity of H-shaped steel-larch composite beams. Comparing the calculation results with the test results, the data are in good agreement, which can provide a design reference for the practical application of such composite beams.},

These models are based on the hypothesis that for temperatures above 300°C , wood is no longer able to sustain any stress, which makes the determination of the location of the 300°C isotherm decisive for the result provided by the models. In this paper, the charring rate model and the conductive model presented in Eurocode 5, Part 1?2 are compared regarding the determination of the location of the 300°C isotherm. The main wood parameters investigated are density, moisture content and anisotropy. The almost complete independence of the charring rate model from these parameters leads to some inconsistencies between the models. To reduce these inconsistencies some proposals to improve the conductive and the charring rate models are presented. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Differences in microstructural detail between wood and char, as well as fissure geometry, were shown to be consistent. The demarcation between damaged and undamaged wood was shown to be extremely small (several cell layers in thickness).

abstract = {Hybrid structures known as timber–steel composites (TSCs) have been extensively studied due to their potential use as alternative construction materials that can satisfy demands related to sustainability. In addition to load capacity, fire resistance is a major consideration regarding the extensive use of TSCs. In this study, 12 specimens were tested using a glulam timber material covering cold-formed steel at the center. Specifically, the TSCs were fabricated from two timber blocks and an I-shaped steel core assembled using dowels or glue as a major structure. In order to use additional timber as a fire protection layer to protect a major structure by its charcoal produced after being burned, an additional timber with 5 cm in thickness was used to cover the major structure. The 1-h fire testing of TSC following the ISO 834-1 standard was applied, in order to achieve the potential application for a 4-story timber building. The results showed that temperatures at the steel flange increased by more than 300 °C for the final 5 min in 10 out of the 12 TSC specimens, indicating that the fire protection provided by the timber structure was not sufficient. The charcoal layer surpassing the extra timber was originally set and entered the steel structure of the TSC, which was expected to retain its physical qualities after a fire. Methods for evaluating the charring properties, based on the conventional method for wood and the standard specification set by Eurocode 5, were used to assess the structural degradation of TSCs. The conventional assessments showed a divergence from the actual performance of TSCs. Such variations demonstrated the limitations of models for conventional wood in assessing the structure of a TSC. A realistic assessment was conducted to expand knowledge related to this composite under destructive processes and provide fire reference values for the practical implementation of TSCs.},

abstract = {Much of the information relating to fire endurance of heavy timber construction has been developed empirically. To remain competitive with other construction materials, precise data are needed for designing and predicting fire endurance of wood assem- blies. This study was designed to determine the charring rates for wood normal to the grain, and to evaluate the effect of fire intensity, species, specific gravity, moisture content, and annual ring orienta- tion on these rates. Other material variables studied were the springwood to summerwood ratio and volatile extractive content. The effect of variation in moisture permeability, however, was not evaluated. Laminated wood slabs, 3 inches thick, of Douglas-fir, southern pine, and white oak were vertically exposed to fire on one surface. The rate of char development was constant when the specimens were exposed to uniformly increasing fire temperatures; charring rates at three constant fire exposure temperatures were described by a pseudo-first-order reaction equation with an Arrhenius temperature-dependent rate constant. Rates of char development in each species were related to the specific gravity and moisture content of the wood. The other material characteristics considered were directly related to specific gravity and moisture content or had no significant effect on the charring rate.},

abstract = {The structural fire resistance of light timber frame walls and floors has traditionally been determined by using standard fire resistance tests to provide a Fire Resistance Rating (FRR). The required FRR was prescribed by building codes and had little relation to likely fire severity. More recently, simple formulae have been used to determine an appropriate FRR given the ventilation parameters of a compartment, the likely fuel load and to a lesser extent the thermal properties of the compartment boundaries. The work described in this thesis determines the validity of these formulae for light timber frame walls and floors and other materials. It is shown that, computer modelling can be used to determine the thermal and structural performance of light timber frame walls and floors exposed to fire. The COMPF-2 program can be used with modification to model compartment fires. The thermal behaviour of cavity walls and floors exposed to fire can be modelled accurately using the TASEF program. The structural behaviour of light timber frame walls and floors exposed to fire can be modelled using a general purpose finite element program, such as ABAQUS. The temperature dependent thermal properties used in the thermal model and the temperature dependent mechanical properties used in the structural model may not be absolutely accurate values, but are effective values that are (modifications of known values within a reasonable range) determined in the calibration process. A simple temperature based failure criterion has been devised for the structural response of light timber frame walls and floors exposed to fires. This study shows that simple time equivalent formulae are not suitable for the prediction of such a complex and variable phenomenon as the response of structures to fire. For accurate prediction of structural response under fire exposure, a more rigorous computer based analysis can be used to give much more reliable results than a simple time equivalent method.},

abstract = {Burning rate is a key factor in modeling fire growth and fire endurance of wood structures. This study investigated the burning rate of selected wood materials as determined by heat release, mass, loss and charring rates. Thick samples of redwood, southern pine, red oak and basswood were tested in a heat release rate calorimeter. Results on ignitability and average heat release, mass loss and charring rates are reported for a heat flux range between 15 and 55 kw m−2. In this range, burning rate increased linearly with heat flux. Burning rate was very species dependent. Heat release rate was related to mass loss by effective heat of combustion, which also increased with heat flux. Charring rate was related to mass loss rate and original wood density. Important char property data such as yield, density and contraction are reported. A simplified calculation method is proposed for calculating mass loss rate and charring rate based on heat release rate. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Janssens2004,
abstract = {To accurately predict the structural performance of a wood member, knowledge is required of the rate at which it chars and the temperature distribution in the residual load-bearing section. The charring rate and temperature distribution can be calculated with a model that predicts the thermal degradation or pyrolysis of wood exposed to a high-temperature environment. More than 50 wood pyrolysis models have been developed since World War II. They range from simple analytical expressions to complex systems of coupled partial differential equations that describe the heat and mass transfer through wood and char. This paper presents a brief overview of the aforementioned models and provides a more detailed description of a new model. This model is referred to by the acronym CROW (Charring Rate Of Wood). Although the intent was to keep CROW as simple as possible, the model accounts for the four major factors that effect the thermal degradation of wood: dry density of the wood; moisture content of the wood; lignin content of the wood; char contraction. The predictive capability of CROW was evaluated on the basis of ASTM E 119 furnace data obtained for a Douglas fir glulam beam tested under different loads. CROW predictions, with some adjustment for moisture effects, are in reasonable agreement with the measurements. The model will be most useful to predict performance of wood members exposed under thermal conditions that deviate from the standard fire (natural or parametric fires) and/or members that the protected by a membrane.

Such assemblies often derive much of their fire resistance from a protective membrane composed of gypsum board. A simple two-dimensional computer model is presented to predict heat transfer through gypsum-board/wood-stud walls exposed to fire. Input data for the thermophysical properties of gypsum board were measured exploying standard bench-scale tests. Input data for wood were selected from the literature. Small-and full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on gypsum-board/wood-stud wall assemblies to provide data for the validation of the model. The model is shown to predict heat transfer through these walls rather well.},

abstract = {The application of cold-formed steel on roof structures in Indonesia has become very popular in construction practices, especially for single- or multi-family dwellings. Compared to timber roof structures, cold-formed steel roof structures may require less or even no maintenance programs as they are absolutely durable against termite and wood-decay fungus attacks. However, lesson learned from recent building failures due to earthquakes indicated that cold-formed steel structures are susceptible to buckling failure. This study attempts to improve buckling performance of coldformed steel members by combining them with timber laminas to obtain cold formed steel - timber composite. This composite member is obtained by attaching 15-mm thick timber laminas (Swietenia mahagoni) to the web part of cold-formed steel Z-, C-, and double C-sections using screws at regular spacing of 100 mm. Compression tests were conducted for five different effective lengths, and the increase in compressive load capacities of the composite members was validated by the results of compression test of cold formed steel (without timber laminas). The test results showed that the failure of composite members was progressive and it was initiated by flange local buckling followed by flexural buckling at the final stage. This failure mode is different from the observed common failure mode of the cold formed steel member which is instantaneous and is a combination of local buckling and flexural-torsional buckling. The increase in compressive load capacity was significant for short members but then decreases as the member length increases. A proposal to predict the compressive load capacity of cold formed steel - timber composite is presented for practical application.},

The results of experimental testing are also presented, emphasizing that the differences in the results obtained were a result of the application of different strengthening methods, test specimens, etc. The need to develop design guidelines related to reinforcement methods is also emphasized. Appropriate reinforcement depends on the application, arrangement and ratio of the reinforcement. The increase in the load-bearing capacity of the beams reinforced by bonded or glued-in plates in comparison to the unreinforced elements was found to be similar to the models reinforced with fibre reinforced polymer (FRP). The increase in stiffness was, however, higher than in the case of the FRP reinforcement. Due to the influence of temperature and humidity on the strength and deformation of the bonding if glued-in or bonded plates are used, additional strengthening of the connection using a mechanical connector is recommended. These connectors also protect against rapid destruction in the case of fire.},

The recently developed timber-steel-concrete ribbed decks were designed according to fire resistance regulations following Eurocode 5 on the basis of a timber layer protecting the inner steel elements. To evaluate the influence of the material combination of timber, concrete and thin steel, which could increase the theoretical fire resistance according to Eurocode 5, a test series was carried out on single ribs with an exemplary cross-section.},

abstract = {Recently, a hybrid structure called Timber-Steel Composite (TSC), which is assembled by a central steel I beam with wooden block covered, is expected to introduce a potential strength for the design of modern wooden structure. However, information on this type of structure under the influence of fire is not yet sufficiently explicit to provide designers with a reliable index. The aim of this research was to study the behavior of TSC with dowel connection under fire. Three TSC with bolt connected were tested and were burnt under temperature 700 °C within 10 minutes. Testing results showed that after 10-minute fire burning, the temperature of central I beam is not of great increased, indicating that the wooden block help transmits heat although the dowel connections which connect steel and wood is directly exposed to the fire. It is also observed that dowel connection and air gaps caused a relatively high percentage of char for the wood surrounding the bolt as 13% of total area. In conclusion, a useful prediction on char depth no more than 5cm could be estimated for 1-hour testing validating the purpose of applying TSC in future.},

abstract = {An innovative steel-timber composite floor for use in multi-storey residential buildings is presented. The research demonstrates the potential of these steel-timber composite systems in terms of bearing capacity, stiffness and method of construction. Such engineered solutions should prove to be sustainable since they combine recyclable materials in the most effective way. The floors consist of prefabricated ultralight modular components, with a Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) slab, joined together and to the main structural system using only bolts and screws. Two novel floor solutions are presented, along with the results of experimental tests on the flexural behavior of their modular components. Bending tests have been performed considering two different methods of loading and constraints. Each prefabricated modular component uses a special arrangement of steel-timber connections to join a CLT panel to two customized cold-formed steel beams. Specifically, the first proposed composite system is assembled using mechanical connectors whereas the second involves the use of epoxy-based resin. In the paper, a FEM model is provided in order to extend this study to other steel-timber composite floor solutions. In addition, the paper contains the design model to be used in dimensioning the developed systems according to the state of the art of composite structures.},

@article{Bartlett2019,
abstract = {This paper presents a review of the pyrolysis, ignition, and combustion processes associated with wood, for application in tall timber construction. The burning behaviour of wood is complex. However the processes behind pyrolysis, ignition, combustion, and extinction are generally well understood, with good agreement in the fire science literature over a wide range of experimental conditions for key parameters such as critical heat flux for ignition (12 kW/m2 ± 2 kW/m2) and heat of combustion (17.5 MJ/kg ± 2.5 MJ/kg). These parameters are key for evaluating the risks posed by using timber as a construction material. Conversely, extinction conditions are less well defined and understood, with critical mass loss rates for extinction varying from 2.5 g/m2s to 5 g/m2s. A detailed meta-analysis of the fire resistance literature has shown that the rate of burning as characterised by charring rate averaged over the full test duration is observed to vary with material properties, in particular density and moisture content which induce a maximum 18% variability over the ranges expected in design. System properties are also shown to be important, with stochastic phenomena such as delamination and encapsulation failure resulting in changes to the charring rate that cannot be easily predicted. Finally, the fire exposure as defined by incident heat flux has by far the largest effect on charring rates over typical heat fluxes experienced in compartment fires. Current fire design guidance for engineered timber products is largely prescriptive, relying on fixed “charring rates” and “zero-strength layers” for structural analyses, and typically prescribing gypsum encapsulation to prevent or delay the involvement of timber in a fire. However, it is clear that the large body of scientific knowledge that exists can be used to explicitly address the fire safety issues that the use of timber introduces. However the application of this science in real buildings is identified as a key knowledge gap which if explored, will enable improved efficiencies and innovations in design.},

abstract = {Physically-based sound rendering enriches 3D animation. However, it is difficult to make an object with a given shape produce a specific sound using physically-based sound rendering because the user would need to define appropriate internal material distribution. To address this, we propose an example-based method to design physically-based sound for a 3D model. Our system optimizes the material distribution inside the 3D model so that physically-based sound rendering produces sounds similar to the target sounds specified by the user. A problem is that modal analysis required for this optimization is prohibitively expensive. In order to run the optimization at an interactive rate, we present fast approximate modal analysis that enables three orders of magnitude acceleration of the eigenproblem computation compared to standard modal analysis for an elastic object. It consists of data-driven online coarsening of the mesh and hierarchical component mode synthesis with efficient error correction. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method with a set of comparisons and examples.},

abstract = {Numerous experiments have been conducted to investigate the mechanical properties of structural steels at elevated temperatures, including mild steel and high strength steel (HSS). However, material models in the current mainstream fire design standards are mainly based on results of mild steel, and hence their applicability to HSS is questionable. In this paper, test data in literatures on mechanical properties of hot-rolled carbon structural steels with strength grades from 235 MPa to 960 MPa at elevated temperatures were comprehensively summarized. The effects of steel manufacturing process, test method, heating rate, and loading rate on the performance of structural steels at elevated temperatures were analysed. It is found that for steels with all the considered grades, reduction factors of the nominal strength specified with 2.0% of strain have similar downward trends. However, downward trends of the reduction factors of Young's modulus, ultimate strength and 0.2% offset yield strength vary with the steel grade. The manufacturing process, test method, heating rate and loading rate all have certain effects on the mechanical properties of steel at elevated temperatures, but the effects on the reduction factors of strength are generally slight. Finally, recommendations on the future research were proposed.},

They are used in situations where load requirements make built-up wood beams impractical and are becoming increasingly popular in residential construction. There is now considerable variation in design methods for flitch beams, and the lack of a specification for them has created the danger that they would not be able to stand up to the extreme conditions typically required in building codes. Using the example of a beam spanning 11.5 ft and carrying a uniformly distributed load of 1,000 lb ft. Wiesenfeld describes a four step design process that involves determining appropriate size of the wood and steel sections, sizing and spacing bolts for load transfer, checking bolt spacing for lateral bracing requirements, and checking bearing stresses resulting from applied loads and reactions.},

These experimental tests were performed on spruce specimens as per the European regulations, and lasted for 30 min. The numerical simulation was developed using the methodology supported by the European regulations (Eurocode 5), and consisted of a transient thermal and static structural coupled system. Numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental ones, so ANSYS and the described methodology prove to be good tools to simulate the performance of timber dovetail connections under a fire event. Traditional failure criteria, which are useful at room temperature, such as Tsai-Wu one, are used in the simulation in order to predict the failure time, but it was demonstrated that this failure criterion is useless at high temperatures, as the ones reached under a 30-min fire event.},

abstract = {Connecting timber panels to steel girders using mechanical fasteners (e.g. screws and bolts) is an attractive and novel method for developing a fully prefabricated and sustainable hybrid steel-timber composite (STC) floor that can also facilitate future dismantling and recycling of the structural components. This study concerns the short-term behaviour of innovative STC floors comprising of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and/or laminated veneer lumber (LVL) panels connected to steel girders by various mechanical fasteners and/or glue. The mechanical characteristics of STC connections play an essential role in the safe and economical design of hybrid STC structures and floor systems. Accordingly, at the first stage of this research project, short-term behaviour of STC connections has been investigated. Push-out tests on different types of STC lap joints with coach screws (with and without a reinforcing nail plate), high-strength bolts and a combination of glued and screwed connectors are reported, and the load-slip behaviour, stiffness, strength and failure modes of the STC connections are characterised. At the second stage, short term behaviour of STC system was investigated through four-point bending tests. The results of four-point bending tests performed on full-scale STC beams are reported and the structural behaviour (i.e. the load-deflection response, short-term stiffness, and peak load capacity and failure modes) of the proposed STC system are studied. At the last stage of the project, extensive non-linear 1D and 2D finite element (FE) analyses of STC beams are carried out and the numerical results are verified against the test results. It is shown that 1D and 2D FE models can adequately capture the structural response of the STC beams. Using the FE and experimental results, the composite efficiency of STC beams that can significantly influence their structural behaviour beams is determined. In addition, the mechanical behaviour of lap STC connections was investigated through using a nonlinear 3D continuum-based FE model. In the FE models developed, the non-linear behaviour and failure of the timber is captured by a stress-based failure criterion formulated in the framework of continuum-damage mechanics. Yielding of the steel plates and fasteners (i.e. coach screws and bolts) is captured by an elastic-hardening plastic constitutive law. These FE models are validated against experimental (push-out) tests conducted on LVL and Steel-CLT composite lap connections. It is shown that the FE models developed can adequately predict the load-slip response and failure mode of the hybrid steel-timber composite connections tested. The validated FE model is used to undertake a parametric study that elucidates the influence of the yield strength and the length of the fasteners and the post-tensioning force in the bolts on the stiffness, load carrying capacity and load-slip behaviour of hybrid steel-timber composite connections.},

abstract = {Cross-sectional strength can be improved with maximized ductility by using a combination of excellent steel and structural glued laminated timber (GLT). In this study, a composite cross-sectional shape in which structural steel bent in the form of two C-channels was inserted into GLT was developed. The three specimens were tested for their flexural performance: a GLT specimen consisting only of pure wood for examining the effect of steel insertion as well as a screw-connected specimen and a specimen using polyurethane adhesive for examining the adhesion of steel according to the connection method. As a result of testing the flexural performance, the composite section connected by self-drilling screws demonstrated the adhesive strength for the steel material to reach the yield stress, but it failed to achieve a fully composite behavior. The polyurethane-adhered composite beam demonstrated fully composite behavior until reaching the maximum load. The flexural strength and stiffness of the polyurethane-adhered composite beam were 1.52 and 1.97 times higher, respectively, than those of the GLT beam, demonstrating an excellent improvement in the strength and stiffness compared with the cross-sectional area.},

abstract = {An investigation has been conducted into measurement errors associated with the thermal disturbance created when a thermocouple is inserted perpendicular to a thermal wave in a charring material of low conductivity. Laminated bamboo was used as the embedding material because in-depth temperature measurements are of practical relevance to the characterisation of this potential building material. A combination of experiments and models have been used to determine the error. Experimental results have shown significant differences between the measurements from thermocouples inserted parallel and perpendicular to the isotherms, in terms of both in-depth temperatures and estimated charring rates. Experimental measurements match well with model predictions that accurately represent the thermal disturbance error. This error has been found to decrease over time following a logarithmic trend, and to increase linearly with increasing distance from the heated surface. Models have been used to ‘correct' the experimental temperature measurements, and the corrected temperatures have been found to closely approximate the results from thermocouples inserted parallel to the heat wave for inert conditions. This approach may be applied further to correct temperature measurements up to the depth of the char layer for more severe heating conditions.},

An experimental programme based on a four-point bending test configuration is proposed to characterize the stiffness, ductility and strength response of strengthened wood beams. Mechanical tests on the strengthened wood showed that external bonding of steel fibers produce high increases in flexural stiffness and capacity. Finally experiment results are used to calibrate existing analytical formulations for capacity prediction.

abstract = {In a pre‐stressed fastener, forces are transmitted between two elements by friction which is made possible by the application of transversal compression forces. The aim of this work was to apply this principle to timber fasteners. Thanks to former results, a preliminary experimental study was done on stubbles of bamboo. This “grass” has a higher transversal compression resistance than wood. In order to transpose the principle of pre‐stress from bamboo to timber, it was necessary to increase the compression resistance of timber. The idea proposed here is the densification of wood by localised cold compression beyond its elastic limit. Picea abies was characterized in transversal compression beyond its elastic limit. This analysis gave stress‐strain curves which depend on the density of the wood. The influence of the densification on the resistance in longitudinal tension was also measured. This resistance is constant and then it decreases rapidly from a critical densification rate function of the density of the wood. The pre‐stress of the tested timber and bamboo fasteners was modelled by a finite elements model. The anisotropy of the materials was taken into account by the superposition of a crushable foam model (non linear behaviour in transversal direction) and beams (longitudinal direction). This structural mesoscopic model allowed simulating the densification, the loading and unloading of the fasteners until their failure which lead to an optimization of the connectors.},

There is a critical need to source other timber species for timber poles. This paper presents a study of using fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites as a confinement system onto plantation softwood for utility poles. The proposed method was a wet layup process using multiple layers of 0°/90° biaxial woven roving E-glass fibre sheets. A series of FRP timber specimens, with different confinement lengths ranging from 0% to 70% of the span length of 5.4 m, were prepared and tested in three-point bending to present two equivalent cantilevers. A timber/FRP composite section with full confinement length was also investigated. Results showed that the FRP system, depending on the confinement length, provided a considerable improvement to the softwood regarding the load carrying capacity and bending stiffness. Theoretical calculation showed a good comparison to the experimental bending stiffness. Finally, finite element results showed satisfactory agreement with the experiments in terms of load carrying capacity and bending stiffness and failure modes.},

abstract = {This paper presents a non-invasive technique for the repair of ancient wooden floors. Steel plates are glued on one side only by epoxy-adhesive into longitudinal grooves in order to allow the free swelling and shrinkage of the wood in the direction transversal to the plate glueing surface, thus reducing the risk of plate delamination. A set of high strength steel nails provides load transmission from the steel plates to the wooden beam in the case of loss of adhesion due to fire or delamination. This technique was used to repair a precious beam in a 15th-century wooden floor in Palazzo Calini (Brescia, Italy). The technique requires particular attention because it might be affected by the delamination of the glued reinforcement due to stress concentration, which occurs at the end of the repairing element or at any cracks in the repaired beam. Results of experimental studies on delamination phenomenon investigated by means of the Moir{\'{e}} interferometry analysis are also presented. These show that the risk of plate debonding can be markedly reduced by the capability of the sapwood to develop plastic strain. The wooden floor has been monitored for more than fourteen years, confirming the effectiveness of the adopted technique.},

As an essential input for the production of crude steel, iron ore feeds the world's largest trillion-dollar-a-year metal market and is the backbone of global infrastructure. To meet the growing demand for steel products, world iron ore production has increased dramatically since 2000. As a result, traditional high-grade iron ore reserves are being significantly depleted and many new iron ore deposits of lower grade and more complicated mineralogy are being mined. This chapter first provides an overview of world iron ore production and trade, as well as reserves and resources, followed by a summary of the key mining operations in the top ten iron ore producing countries. Some key challenges currently facing the industry from declining ore grades through to increased environmental scrutiny, social issues and uncertainty around commodity prices are then discussed in detail. In order to reduce costs and its environmental footprint while improving productivity and sustainability, the iron ore industry has continuously fostered innovation and integration of new technology into its practices. Consequently, the level of technology adopted by the iron ore industry is highly advanced. Some examples of emerging technologies that have been adopted by innovative iron ore producers to gain a financial and/or safety edge on their competitors are provided.},

abstract = {As timber is a combustible material, fire safety is a significant obstacle for the development of timber usage in buildings. Among the various structural components, the connections are often the weakest elements in a timber construction. In fire as well as in normal conditions, they govern the load-bearing capacity of the structure. However, a lack of knowledge is pointed out for the design of connections in normal conditions and even more in fire conditions. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element approach is developed to investigate the performance of dowelled timber connections in fire. The 3D mechanical model and the thermo-physical model for each connection component are described. For the mechanical model, the plastic behaviour of the materials is considered using the Von Mises criterion for steel and the Hill criterion for timber. Then a thermal and mechanical validation of the proposed model is achieved by comparison with the experimental results in normal and fire situations. The analysis is then focused on the behaviour of dowelled timber connections in a fire situation. Thus, timber-to-timber and steel-to-timber connections with fasteners of 12 to 20 mm in diameter are studied considering a load in direct tension parallel to the grain. A parametric analysis, based on the numerical model, is done to evaluate the influence of the timber thickness on the reduction of the load-bearing capacity of the connections. This influence is evaluated considering the time of fire resistance to deduct simple design methods. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Since 2010, twelve post-tensioned timber (Pres-Lam) buildings have been constructed throughout the world. The technology relies on unbonded post-tensioning tendons to provide moment capacity to beam-column, wall-foundation, or column-foundation connections. Supplemental energy dissipation can be introduced by mild steel bars or replaceable damping devices when designing buildings for high seismic risk areas. Creep within the timber elements leads to losses in post-tensioning force over time. The amount of post-tensioning loss depends on the members' geometry, environmental service conditions, and the initial moisture content of wood. This paper presents a design approach for estimating, via hand calculations, the amount of post-tensioning loss expected for the most common design configurations.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper gives a review of the design rules of EN 1995-1-2, the future common code of practice for the fire design of timber structures in the Member States of the EU and EFTA, and makes reference to relevant research background. Compared with the European pre-standard ENV 1995-1-2, the new EN 1995-1-2 has undergone considerable changes. Charring is dealt with in a more systematic way and different stages of protection and charring rates are applied. For the determination of cross-sectional strength and stiffness properties, two alternative rules are given, either by implicitly taking into account their reduction due to elevated temperature by reducing the residual cross-section by a zero-strength zone, or by calculating modification factors for strength and stiffness parameters. Design rules for charring and modification factors are also given for timber frame members of wall and floor assemblies with cavities filled with insulation. A modified components additive method has been included for the verification of the separating function. The design rules for connections have been systemized by introducing simple relationships between the load-bearing capacity (mechanical resistance) and time. The code provides for advanced calculation methods for thermal and structural analysis by giving thermal and thermo-mechanical properties for FE analyses. The code also gives some limited design rules for natural fire scenarios using parametric fire curves. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Due to improvements in the use of recyclable materials in construction, timber-steel composite (TSC) beams demonstrate high potential for future construction. In this study, a proposed simulation modeling, which was adopted from the simulation modeling of a timber I-shape composite, was applied to estimate the initial stiffness of TSC beams. The strength of each beam could be determined once the initial stiffness was estimated. In addition, a series of experiments were performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed simulation modeling, including the effects of different shapes of steel members, fasteners, and applying and not applying a dowel connection. The results indicated that the simulation modeling could adequately determine strength at a deflection of 1/360 of the span. The ratio of difference between the experimental results and the simulation modeling results was less than 10% if a dowel connection at the web was applied. However, the ratio of difference reached 26% and 24% in the TSC beams without a dowel connection at the web that were fastened with screws and nails at the flange, respectively, revealing the importance of applying a dowel connection at the web. Moreover, the strength of the TSC beams with a dowel connection at the web that were fastened by screws was approximately 15% higher than that of TSC beams without screw fasteners. In conclusion, the proposed simulation modeling can provide designers with a method for estimating the initial stiffness and strength of TSC beams within a deflection of 1/360 of the span, supporting the future application of TSC beams in construction.},

abstract = {Flitch beams are a form of sandwich construction using steel and timber elements. They are used in the construction of domestic dwellings when relatively high loads and long spans predominate but available depth of section is restricted in some way. Traditional flitch beams use a bolted connection to hold the elements together, which is a time consuming method of fabrication requiring the pre-drilling of holes in the steel and timber elements. It also presents problems in design detailing. Bolt slippage and fabrication tolerances result in disproportionate stress transfer due to uneven strain affecting the stiffness and strength properties of the beam. This paper details the findings from a series of laboratory tests and parametric studies on flitch beams constructed from either Kerto S Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) or C24 grade timber using a shot-fired dowel connection. The tests showed that during the elastic range proportional stress transfer took place. However, at higher load levels there is uneven stress transfer due to localised buckling of the steel in the top chord and a weakening of the timber elements of the beam due to splitting at the nailing points.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the temperature distribution within glued laminated timbers (glulams) made from five softwood species as determined by a standard fire exposure test (CNS12514). The results reveal that the temperature within the middle section of tested glulam increased with increasing fire exposure time. After a fire exposure of 30 min and 45 min, the average temperature in the center of middle section for tested glulams (with a cross-section of 266 mm in depth × 190 mm in width) ranged from 27.5-28.3 °C to 29.5-33.2 °C; whereas, the average temperature for tested glulams (with a cross-section of 266 mm in depth × 140 mm in width) increased rapidly (from 32.3-51.1 °C to 39.1-89.3 °C) with an increasing exposure time and a decreasing cross-section. It was also found that the temperature in the center of the middle section increased slower than that in the right side or left side of a glulam middle section. The temperature within glulams (78 mm from the surface) remained constant without significant influence of fire exposure time according to CNS 12514. It can also be observed that equations developed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology give a closer calculation for the temperature development in tested glulams with heat flux from three sides. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These structural challenges can vary from inadequate load carrying capacity to complexities involved with choice of repair materials and techniques. Given the recurring requirements of conservation authorities in terms of reversibility of interventions and compatibility between historic and new materials, an increase in the use of non-invasive reinforcement materials and reversible techniques was observed. Subsequently, engineers and researchers have increasingly employed stainless steel alloys in retrofitting historic timber structures. This paper therefore presents the state of the art in the use of stainless steel profiles in retrofitting timber structural elements within historic structures. It includes a review of the development of the retrofitting methods and existing experimental studies on the mechanical behavior of timber structures reinforced with stainless steel. Finally, it presents a number of case studies and draws conclusions on current trends and practices based on reported studies.},

abstract = {Modern timber construction techniques rely on metallic connectors. Their failure during fires is related to shear failure, which can happen at lower temperatures than those leading to pyrolysis. Based on this information, a series of tests were carried out exposing wood specimens to various heat fluxes in a Cone Calorimeter on a vertical configuration with no pilot ignition and a normal air atmosphere. The aim of this investigation was to develop a dependable temperature measurement methodology in wood samples exposed to high heat fluxes and to build a data-base in order to assess different wood pyrolysis models. The experiments yielded highly repeatable results that are hard to achieve with wood, although at lower heat fluxes the repeatability was poorer. The data were then normalized using a simple, inert, heat transfer model. It will be used as a tool to assess the importance of different terms that are incorporated in models that predict in-depth temperature profiles for wood. The samples behaved almost like an inert solid when subjected to low heat fluxes. Poorer repeatability at the lower levels of heat flux is justified by the beginning of pyrolytic reactions in wood at about 10 kW m-2. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract For the thermal analysis of structural or non-structural timber members, using conventional simplified heat transfer models, thermal conductivity values of timber are normally calibrated to test results such that they implicitly take into account influences such as mass transport that are not included in the model. Various researchers and designers have used such effective thermal conductivity values, originally determined for standard fire exposure, to evaluate other fire scenarios such as natural fires. This paper discusses in qualitative terms some parameters that govern the burning of wood and their influence on effective conductivity values. Reviewing fire tests of timber slabs under natural fire conditions, the study explains why effective conductivity values, giving correct results for the ISO 834 standard fire scenario, should not be used in other fire scenarios. For this reason, the thermal properties of timber given in EN 1995-1-2 are limited to standard fire exposure. As shown by heat transfer calculations, the effective thermal conductivity of the char layer is strongly dependent on the charring rate and therefore varies during a natural fire scenario. It has also been shown that char oxidation during the decay phase in a natural fire has a significant influence on the temperature development in the timber member, since char surface temperatures exceed the gas temperature in the compartment or furnace. Using increased effective gas temperature as thermal action during the decay phase, and varying conductivity values for the char layer, fairly good agreement could be obtained regarding the temperature development in the timber member and the char depth.

abstract = {A model has been formulated for the pyrolysis of wood. This model includes heat and mass transfer. Heat transfer in the material is assumed to take place by thermal conduction and convection. Mass transfer of volatile pyrolysis products and water vapour occurs under the influlence of gradients in to tal pressure. Pyrolysis is assumed to conform to an Arrheniusfunction, and vaporization occurs at a rate which is governed by the assumption that complete saturation in the pore systemis attained so long as there is water left at the point being studied. The boundary conditions are governed by a gas temperature time curve or the energy flow rate. The energy balance at the boundary also includes oxidation of the charcoal layer and the effectof the outward gas flow on the thermal surface resistance. Solution of the problem is studied by solving two non linear partial differential equations: - one which yields the temperature distribution and- one which yields the pressure distribution. The problem has been formulated using the finite element method. The numerical solutions have been compared with experiments. There is good agreement between the experimental and the calculated results. The importance of taking the initial moisture content into accounts evident from both the experiments and the calculations. Owingt to the pressure gradients which arise, there is a gradual and steeprise in moisture content. In those parts of the material where the temperature is above 100° C, vaporization occurs. The pressure gradients give rise to a mass flow directed towards the cooler parts of the material where the water vapour condenses.},

abstract = {An increased environmental conscientiousness in society and the abundance of timber in Canada has inevitably led to the desire for more timber construction. In order to increase the opportunity for timber products in construction, novel building systems such as post-tensioned (PT) timber have been developed. Limited development on numerical modelling has been done on PT timber systems for the optimization of design for fire performance. In industry, there is need for a modelling software capable of approximating complex timber system behaviours that is accessible to practitioners. This research program serves to evaluate the current capabilities or shortcomings of modelling PT timber in both ambient and fire conditions, and to develop a methodology for analyzing the performance of the system. Several numerical models of PT timber beam tests are developed and validated using general purpose FEM software ABAQUS. This software is a good research tool and the lessons learned may be used to refine an accessible model for practitioners. Various material definitions are compared including isotropic and orthotropic models. The numerical models show highly promising results for demonstrating the loading and failure behaviour of PT timber beams. Material property directionality is paramount, captured best with the use of Hill's Potential Function for non-elastic behaviour. Ambient beam tests are modelled with accurately demonstrated load–deflection behaviour and peak loads are computed to within 5% of experimentally recorded values. For PT timber beam standard fire furnace tests, beam failure times are modelled within 3 min of experimental beam failure times for various fire exposure durations (about 5%), and load–deflection behaviour and failure mechanisms are accurately demonstrated. Thermal gradients align with the recorded thermocouple readings and char depths are computed within 4 mm of the observed layers.},

@article{Dar2018,
abstract = {To address the various instability problems in cold-formed steel members, many researchers have mainly focused on developing innovative sectional profiles wherein geometry of the section plays a vital role in enhancing the inherent resistance of such sections against premature buckling. However, the process of forming such innovative shapes is not only complex and time-consuming but sometimes such sections fail to mobilize their complete reserve strength. Hence, a stiffening arrangement of weaker zones for mobilizing the untapped reserve strength is suggested. The contribution of this simple, effective and partly stiffening arrangements, aimed at eliminating/delaying the premature local buckling, is studied both experimentally and numerically and also compared with existing codes. Experimental study was carried out on different simply supported cold-formed steel beams with judiciously proposed stiffening arrangements under four-point loading. An equivalent hot-rolled steel beam was also tested to compare the efficiency of the cold-formed steel beams. The cold-formed steel beams investigated had different width-to-thickness ratio, different geometries and different stiffening arrangements. The test strengths, failure modes, deformed shapes, load versus mid-span displacements and geometric imperfections were measured and reported. The test strengths of the beam models are also compared with the design strength predicted by North American Standards and Eurocode for cold-formed steel structures. To validate the test results further, a numerical study was carried out on such stiffened cold-formed steel beams using finite element software ABAQUS. All these results show that the proposed strengthening system is efficient and economical and allow cold-formed steel beams to reach greater load carrying capacity.},
